## [0.3.13] - 2025-09-07

### Added
- **Security Enhancements**:
  - Implemented `sanitize_input` function in `prompt.py` to prevent prompt injection attacks by removing or escaping common injection patterns and sensitive keywords (e.g., "ignore previous instructions", "grading logic").
  - Added input sanitization for student code, README content, and JSON reports to ensure safe inclusion in LLM prompts.
  - Introduced random delimiters to wrap content and prevent malicious prompt manipulation.
  - Added a `sleep 1` command in `build.yml` to stabilize pipeline execution by introducing a brief delay before running `entrypoint.py`.
  - Added guardrail instructions in `prompt.py` to restrict LLM behavior to providing feedback based solely on provided test results, student code, and assignment instructions.

### Changed
- **Build Workflow** (`build.yml`):
  - Reordered the model matrix to prioritize `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` and `google/gemma-2-9b-it`, ensuring consistency in model testing order.
  - Updated `actions/checkout` from `v4` to `v5` for improved performance and compatibility.
  - Changed default model from `gemini` to `gemini-2.5-flash` for improved performance and accuracy.
- **README** (`README.md`):
  - Updated project description to highlight enhanced security against prompt injection attacks.
  - Added details about new security features (input sanitization and random delimiters) in the "Key Features" and "Notes" sections.
  - Changed input parameters (`report-files`, `student-files`, `readme-path`) to have no default values, requiring explicit configuration for clarity.
  - Updated default model in input table and example workflow to `gemini-2.5-flash`.
  - Added note about prompt injection mitigation, emphasizing use in controlled environments.
  - Updated future enhancements to include advanced parsing for stronger prompt injection defenses.
  - Added troubleshooting guidance for prompt injection anomalies.
  - Updated acknowledgments to reflect contributions from `Gemini 2.5 Flash` instead of `Gemini 2.0 Flash`.
- **Prompt Logic** (`prompt.py`):
  - Applied input sanitization to `longrepr`, `stderr`, student code, README content, and locale files to prevent prompt injection.
  - Added guardrail instruction in `get_initial_instruction` to enforce strict adherence to feedback tasks.
  - Improved type hints and function signatures for better code clarity and maintainability.
  - Optimized string handling by replacing newlines with spaces and limiting input length to 10,000 characters to prevent prompt structure disruption.
- **Tests** (`test_prompt.py`):
  - Improved test assertions with descriptive error messages for better debugging.
  - Simplified test code by removing redundant tuple conversions and map operations.
  - Updated test fixtures and assertions to align with sanitized input handling.
  - Renamed test functions to follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `test__exclude_common_contents__single` to `test_exclude_common_contents__single`).
  - Updated `expected_default_gemini_model` fixture to reflect the new default model `gemini-2.5-flash`.
  - Enhanced `test_collect_longrepr__compare_contents` to track found markers and report missing ones explicitly.
  - Corrected minor typos and formatting in test comments and strings (e.g., standardized language terms like "Foutmelding" for Dutch).

### Fixed
- Ensured consistent handling of README content by sanitizing inputs in `assignment_instruction` and `exclude_common_contents` to prevent malicious patterns from affecting prompt generation.
- Fixed potential issues in test suite by adding explicit type checking and non-empty string validation in `test_collect_longrepr__has_list_items_len`.
- Addressed missing marker detection in `test_collect_longrepr__compare_contents` by tracking found markers instead of modifying the marker list.

## [v0.3.12] - 2025-09-07

### Added
- Support for multiple LLM providers (Claude, Gemini, Grok, NVIDIA NIM, Perplexity) with dedicated configuration classes in `llm_configs.py`.
- `llm_client.py` for robust API interaction with retry, timeout, and error handling.
- Comprehensive integration tests in `build.yml` for multiple models (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `grok-code-fast`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `google/gemma-2-9b-it`, `sonar`) using both action and environment variable inputs.
- Model-to-provider mapping in `get_model_key_from_env()` to handle precise model IDs.

### Changed
- Updated `entrypoint.py` to support flexible model selection with fallback to `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- Modified `.dockerignore` and `Dockerfile` to include `llm_client.py` and `llm_configs.py`.
- Updated `action.yml` inputs: `report-files`, `student-files`, `readme-path` now required; `model` defaults to `gemini`; added `fail-expected`.
- Updated `GeminiConfig` default model to `gemini-2.5-flash` from `gemini-2.0-flash`.
- Updated `GrokConfig` default model to `grok-code-fast` from `grok-2-1212`.
- Enhanced `tests/test_entrypoint.py` to align with new fallback model (`gemini-2.5-flash`) and added test for `INPUT_API-KEY`.
- Improved logging checks in `tests/test_llm_client.py` for robustness.
- Added file markers in `tests/test_integration.py` and `tests/test_prompt.py`.

### Fixed
- Resolved 404 errors in integration tests for `google/gemma-2-9b-it` and `sonar` by adding model-to-provider mapping in `get_model_key_from_env()`.
- Fixed test failures in `test_get_model_key_from_env__fallback_gemini` and `test_get_model_key_from_env__no_model_fallback_gemini` by updating expected model to `gemini-2.5-flash`.

## [v0.3.7] - 2025-08-01

### Added
- **Flexible LLM Selection**: Added support for Claude, Grok, Nvidia NIM, and Perplexity alongside Gemini, with automatic fallback to Gemini or a single available API key if the specified modelâ€™s key is unavailable (`entrypoint.py`).
- **C/C++ Support**: Extended feedback capabilities to C/C++ assignments, using `pytest` and `pytest-json-report` to analyze compiled code (e.g., via `ctypes`) in a Docker environment (`README.md`).
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added new test cases in `test_entrypoint.py` to cover single-key scenarios, Gemini fallback, empty key handling, and invalid model cases.

### Changed
- **Updated README**: Renamed to "AI Code Tutor" to reflect C/C++ and Python support. Clarified dependencies (`pytest==8.3.5`, `pytest-json-report==1.5.0`, `pytest-xdist==3.6.1`, `requests==2.32.4`) and API key setup with `INPUT_` prefix (e.g., `INPUT_GOOGLE_API_KEY`). Improved YAML example for GitHub Classroom with Docker-based C/C++ testing.
- **Enhanced Model Selection Logic**: Refactored `get_model_key_from_env` in `entrypoint.py` to handle missing `INPUT_MODEL`, prioritize specified model, and fall back to Gemini or single available key. Improved error messages for clarity.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added `try-except` for writing to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` in `entrypoint.py` to handle permission issues in GitHub Actions.
- **Test Refinements**: Removed `mock_env_api_keys` fixture in `test_entrypoint.py` for better isolation, using `monkeypatch` directly. Updated tests to align with new model selection logic and `ValueError` exceptions.
- **Code Cleanup**: Streamlined `entrypoint.py` by removing redundant comments, improving type hints (e.g., `key: str` in `get_startwith`), and organizing `get_config_class` logic with a separate `get_config_class_dict`.

### Fixed
- **API Key Handling**: Fixed potential `KeyError` in `entrypoint.py` by using `os.getenv` with defaults, ensuring robust environment variable access.
- **Test Accuracy**: Corrected `test_get_model_key_from_env__invalid_model_no_gemini` to expect valid fallback to a single available key (e.g., Claude) instead of an error.

### Removed
- **Docker Badges**: Temporarily removed Docker Hub badges from `README.md` to align with updated deployment instructions (pending re-addition with verified image updates).
